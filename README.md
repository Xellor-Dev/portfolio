## üë®‚Äçüíª About The Project

This repository hosts the code for my **personal business card website** and portfolio. It serves as a static, multi-lingual, and responsive single-page application designed to present me as a **Junior Python Backend Developer**.

The primary goal is to clearly showcase my technical skills and professional objectives, while demonstrating foundational front-end skills in modern web development.

### üí° Key Features

* **Multi-lingual (i18n):** Supports 4 languages (EN, UA, PL, RU) via client-side JavaScript.
* **Backend Focus:** Prioritizes technical skills and objectives with a dedicated, chip-based display.
* **Modern Aesthetics:** Dark theme with an **Electric Violet** accent, smooth hover effects, and scroll animations.
* **Responsive:** Fully optimized for all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS.
* **Fast Deployment:** Static HTML file, perfect for instant hosting on GitHub Pages.
